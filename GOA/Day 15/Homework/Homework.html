<p> With a name like Sphere, only one thing comes to mind - a really, really big sphere. Luckily, the building delivers on that promise. <br> Holding 18,600 seats and 875,000 square feet of space, this is currently the largest spherical building in the world. <br> It took the mantle from Stockholm’s Avicii Arena, which held the record since 1989. Naturally, constructing such a large building requires some serious effort. <br> And that’s where the fourth-largest crane in the world came into play. Transported from Belgium, the Demag crane stands 580 feet tall and took eighteen days to build. </p>

<p> Imagine a world where Lego mini-figures come to life! <br>
    Well, if these tiny, colourful characters were humans, they’d have the biggest population on Earth! <br>
    That’s even bigger than China which currently has the biggest population in the world. </p>

<h2><b> 3. Astronauts grow taller in SPACE </b></h2>

<p> When astronauts venture into space, the lack of gravity allows their spines to stretch out, making them taller. How cool is that? <br>

    Just imagine reaching for the stars and coming back taller than before! </p>
